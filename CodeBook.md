#### (for the output dataset)

The output dataset generated by my script is exported as a CSV file named "*outputDataset.csv*" to the working directory. 

The output dataset contains 4 distinct types of column variables.
* *subjectID* : the current record of other variables correspond to the subject identified by a number from 1 to 30.
* *activityPerformed* : the values of measurements recorded was during a specific activity, identifed by a number from 1 to 6.
* variables measuring *acceleration* : The values are measured in *metres per second squared*.
* variables measuring *angular velocity* : The values are measured in *radians per second*.


**Accelerators measure acceleration with respect to three axes (X,Y and Z). Gyroscopes measure angular velocity.**
